# Bootleg

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shaharke/bootleg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shaharke/bootleg)


Bootleg is an extensible initialization layer for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
applications that has been heavily inspired by [Bootable](https://github.com/jaredhanson/bootable).

Bootleg allows initialization *phases* to be registered for an application.
These phases will be executed sequentially during startup, after which the
application will be ready to run.

The main difference between Bootleg and Bootable is that Bootleg works with promises to evaluate
the execution of phases.


## Install

    $ npm install bootleg

## Usage

    const bootleg = require('bootleg');

    module.exports = function bootApp() {
    const app = bootleg();

    // pass the phase name and you're module that you want to execute.
    // the module that you require need to be wrapped with function, object module won't work.
    
    app.phase('phase1', require('my_modules/file_name'));

    // now you can pass the first module to the next phase as a parameter!

    app.phase('phase2', require('my_modules/another_file_name'), @phase1);
    
    return app.boot().then((components) => {
    }).done();

## Tests

    $ npm install
    $ npm test
